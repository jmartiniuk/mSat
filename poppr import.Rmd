Combining design and data files for OCP data, 2013-2015
```{r}
ocpDes <- read.csv("ocpDes.csv", header = TRUE)
ocpDat <- read.csv("ocpDat.csv", header = TRUE)
str(ocp13Des)
str(ocp13Dat)
#keep all unmatched *S. bayanus* records from the design file in the combined output data frame (all.x = T)
ocp <- merge(ocpDes, ocpDat, all.x = TRUE, row.names = F)
str(ocp)
#export combined file for editing (add in species)
write.csv(ocp, "ocp_all.csv", row.names = TRUE)
ocp <- read.csv("ocp_all_mod.csv")
#Add poppr id column
require(dplyr)
ocp <- mutate(ocp, poppr_id = paste(species, vintage, vineyard, fermRep, timepoint, sep = "_"))
# change NAs for Su to 1 so that they are not omitted from import into poppr
ocpPoppr <- ocp[, c(12, 29, 13:28)]
colnames(ocpPoppr) <- c("isolateId", "popprId", "C3", "", "C5", "", "C8", "", "C4",  "", "O91", "", "AT4", "", "SCAAT3", "", "OO9", "")
#make poppr-formatted file
# export relevant info. Convert to genalex format in excel (Add two rows, top row containing no. loci, no. samples, no. pops. Change loci names to 1 per locus, no numbering)
write.csv(ocpPoppr, "ocpPoppr.csv", row.names = F)
#import genalex file
ocpCommPoppr <- read.genalex("ocpPoppr.csv")

gendist <- bruvo.dist(ocpCommPoppr, replen = c(3,2,3,3,3,2,3,3))
gendist <- as.matrix(gendist)
gendist <- gendist[1:775, 776:ncol(gendist)]
